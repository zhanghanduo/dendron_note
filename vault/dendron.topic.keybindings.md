# Keybindings

Dendron uses VSCode [keybinding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) functionality to define its own keybindings. 

To update your keybindings, open the command prompt and type `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`.

You can read more about keybinding syntax [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)
