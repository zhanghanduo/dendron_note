## Commenting and Reviews

### For Dendrologists
The easiest way to leave a comment is by using the [code stream extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream).

You should have received an invite to be part of the **Dendrologist** team (if not, ping Kevin).  

After you install the extension and log in, you'll be able to leave comments inline in the the docs!
