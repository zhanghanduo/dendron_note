# Lookup

To work with notes, Dendron uses  **lookups**. Lookups help you create, find, and organize your notes. You can watch the following video to see some of the things you can do with lookups.

## Notes

### Finding Notes

Below is an example of a simple two level hierarchy with notes on various [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) commands. Use `Cmd+L` (we are going to use mac keybindings for this tutorial) to bring up the lookup and try some of the following queries.

```
- cli.tar
- cli.curl
- cli.dig
```

### Creating Notes

While we call it the `Lookup Bar`, you can also use it to create notes that don't exist. When you lookup for a note that hasn't been created, Dendron will create it for you. 

To try it yourself, bring up the lookup bar. Type `dendron.lookup.hello` and hit `Enter`.

#### Creating Special Notes

Dendron has builtin notion for certain notes with special naming conventions. Dendron has shortcuts to trigger the creation of such notes.

<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  
## Journal Note

A journal note is a self contained note that is meant to track something over time. Examples of journals include recording **workout sessions**, making **meeting notes**, and keeping a **mood journal**.

To create a journal note, trigger a lookup and then click on the calendar icon.

<img style="" src="https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/3c3ddc1dc63547cea8bf186bec31f71b-with-play.gif"> </a>

By default, Dendron will create the journal note with the following hierarchy `{domain}.journal.{Y-MM-DD}`. `{domain}` is the **domain** of the current active note when you execute `New Journal Note`.

## Scratch Note

A scratch note is a self contained note that is meant to be used as scratchpad. Use it for thoughts or when you want to expand on a bullet point. Scratch notes are created in the `scratch` domain and have the following format: `{domain}.journal.{Y-MM-DD-HHHHmmss}`.

### Creating Notes with a Selection

If you have text highlighted while creating a new note with a lookup, the new note will be created using the text selected. How the text will be used depends on  the `dendron.defaultLookupCreateBehavior` setting.

- values: 
  - selectionExtract (default): create new note with text from the old note. remove text from the old note
  - selection2link: create new empty note and turn selection into a link referencing the old note

### Deleting Notes

To delete `dendron.lookup.hello`, use the `Cmd+Shift+D` shortcut on the note that you want to delete. Alternatively, you can also launch the `Command Bar` and type `Dendron: Delete Node` 

## Schemas

Dendron also provides lookup for [schemas ](c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052). To lookup a schema, use `> Dendron: Lookup Schema` or the `Cmd+Shift+L` (`Ctrl+Shift+L` on windows and linux) shortcut to bring up the schema lookup.

### Finding Schemas

The process for finding schemas using Dendron is the same as that for finding notes. One lookup to rule them all.

### Creating Schemas

Just like with notes, if you enter the name of a schema that does not exist, Dendron will create it for you.

Specifically, Dendron will create `{value}.schema.yml` in your vault. At this point, you are free to edit the schema. After you're satisfied with the result, you'll need to run [> Dendron: Reload Index](eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47) for it to take affect. 

- NOTE: if you get an error after running `Reload Index`, it is most likely because your YAML is malformed. You can paste it in [yaml lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check that you are using the correct yaml syntax.

### Deleting Schemas

The process for deleting schemas using Dendron is identical to deleting notes.
