        Unlike what Mark Zuckerberg might want you to believe, people weren't meant to share EVERYTHING with EVERYONE. Use this to keep private lines private!

        When one introduces note refs, one must also introduce a command to easily copy note refs.

    desc: |
        Wouldn't it be nice to have a magic wand to make all your problems go away? While we're working on that, you can use the `Archive Hierarchy Command` to hide hierarchies that you no longer use.

        Do you want to change the past? Us to. And now you can (when it comes to hierarchies). Instead of living with the consequences of bad past decisions (when it comes to hiearchies), you can now change it!
