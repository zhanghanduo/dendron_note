note: |
  Dendron turns 0.10 today üå≤. To mark this milestone, the pre-amble for this release will be a tad longer (and more sentimental) than usual. 
  
  This week's release focuses on publication and exports. Dendron sites now come with [one click collaboration support](TODO), [note references](TODO), and [hierarchy hints](TODO). If publishing online isn't your jam, you'll be happy to know that you can now [export your notes](TODO) to any format you desire (as long as that format is JSON üòÖ - more formats coming soon).

  It's now been almost two months since Dendron first went into preview. Since launch, we've passed over a thousand downloads and closed over [100 issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) worth of features, enhancements, and bug fixes. 

  In that time, we've also build an awesome community of Dendrites on Discord now numbering in the triple digits. I feel beyond grateful to everyone that has given Dendron a try in these early days üå± and become a part of our budding community. 
  
  Speaking of community, I would like to recognize two new **Dendrologist** - [Fay√ßal](https://github.com/d3vr) (@bsqrd#9701 ) and [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho) (@jojanaho#3766 ) üë®‚Äçüåæüë©‚Äçüåæ

  Dendrologists are active members of the Dendron community that will be helping me shape our roadmap, answer questions, and collect feedback from all of you.

    cmsg: 'Support offset with note refs'
    desc: |
        A note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a note reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embeding.
        - NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value

        ```
        ((ref:[[demo.embed.block]]#head1,1))
        ```

    cmsg: 'Support note references when Publishing Notes'
    desc: |
        Dendron has [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]] that let you inline either the whole note or parts of a note into another note. Publishing via Dendron will also publish note references as part of the process.
