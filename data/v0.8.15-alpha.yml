    This week's focus was on improving the initial Dendron startup experience as well as the overall usability. To that end, we introduced our own tree view, overhauled the getting started experience and created a cheatsheet of all commands (with GIFs of course). 

    We also took time to fix bugs and improve performance across Dendron's core features (eg. Lookup, Markdown Preview, etc).

    desc: |
        The Dendron Tree View lets you view your hierarchal notes as a traditional folder hierarchy. It has the following capabilities
            - click to open note
            - show indicators for `stub` and `schema` notes
            - show title using tooltip
            - realtime update when you create/delete notes
            - toggle all functionality
            - reveal currently open text document
